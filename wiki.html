Display advertising is a fancy word for Banner advertising.\r\n                      That means the product or marketer needs to make an advertisement which fits into a box. Banner advertising gets a bad rap, and\r\n                      with the increase of ad-blocking, it has gotten a very bad rap. But, banner ads are not considered intrusive. They are best when\r\n                      they are simple, static images which load quickly across websites. Usually banner advertising is accepted as a tactic to help\r\n                      drive overall product recognition and help increase the amount of search traffic. But, done correctly and it can drive quality\r\n                      website traffic AND post-click conversions, or conversions driven by users clicking on the ads and buying/signing up. If it\r\n                      didn\u2019t work, we wouldn\u2019t be here.

The goal of\r\n                      advertising is persuasion, and insofar as humans have sought to influence each other, advertising has been around in one form or\r\n                      another. Present day advertising utilizes a variety of media and cutting edge technology to communicate targeted messages to\r\n                      audiences across the globe. From the early days of the printing press that enabled ads to circulate widely in newspapers, to the\r\n                      invention of the television and Internet, advertising has evolved alongside technology, refining the ways in which advertisers\r\n                      can target audiences.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Advertising can be traced back to the Ancient world, and remains of ads have been found in Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, Rome\r\n                      and Arabia. Sales Messages written in papyrus and wall rock paintings were the earliest forms of Out of Home (OOH) advertising\r\n                      like billboards. Ads in the ancient world, and for thousands of years thereafter, would remain highly localized. Image at side\r\n                      reflect a bronze plate ad for the Liu Family Needle Shop circa 990 Business was centered on local communities and commerce was\r\n                      restricted due to difficulties with transportation.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      With the advent of deep water navigation in the 15th Century, the most powerful empires of Europe began globalizing the world\r\n                      via major trade routes which opened new markets. This coupled at the same time with the invention of the printing press, sellers\r\n                      could mass-produce ads to be placed in newspapers that could be circulated far and wide. As the world entered the industrial\r\n                      revolution in the 18th Century, the capacity to produce goods and the ability to widely distribute them continued to increase\r\n                      dramatically. In response sellers began to \u201cbrand\u201d their goods, developing products with the goal of becoming household names.\r\n                      Early examples of these include James Lock & Co, a UK based men\u2019s hatfitter established in 1676 and Hundson Bay Company, a\r\n                      Canadian retailer founded in 1670. See the Tobacco ad to side circa 1675.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      A brand is defined as a product that is marketed in a uniform fashion, ultimately establishes its own \u201cpersonality\u201d and\r\n                      originates form a given source. Ranchers began \u201cbranding\u201d their cattle two hundred years ago with hot iron images stamped onto\r\n                      their cattle. Advertisers would approach newspaper publishers directly to buy space on the page and promote their brands. The\r\n                      benefit to both parties was clear: the publications could focus on the number of people who would be exposed to the\r\n                      advertisement and sell this opportunity to those looking to promote their business. The business would gain exposure and the\r\n                      publications would generate revenue. As America entered the 20th Century, a variety of new media emerged to deliver ads to\r\n                      consumers including radio and TV were present in almost every home in the country. Radio advertising began to bloosom in the\r\n                      1920\u2019s and the 1950\u2019s for television.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Along with the increase and diversity of media space available, a new business evolved: the advertising agency. These Madison\r\n                      Avenue organizations would assist advertisers in creating \u2018cutting edge messaging\u2019. In today\u2019s model, agencies focused on\r\n                      messaging are called \u201ccreative agencies\u201d. \u2018Creative\u2019 is the industry term for the actual content of the ad, whether that be the\r\n                      picture for a billboard, the 15-second audio clip for radio, the 30-second visual ad for television, or the 3\"x 2\" message\r\n                      tailored for a newspaper. These early agencies would also assist in placing the messaging in the best publications or locations.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      As the industry grew, the responsibility of placing the creative in well-targeted publications spun off into a separate business\r\n                      model. These companies came to be called \u201cMedia agencies\u201d. Once the \u2018assets\u2019 or \u2018creative\u2019 were produced, the \u2018Media Agency\u2019\r\n                      determined which medium and which publisher they should pay to show the advertisements. These Media Agencies focused on\r\n                      aggregating advertisers in order to create leverage with pricing or buying power. By amassing a portfolio of large (high\r\n                      spending) advertisers, these agencies could force publishers (the biggest being the TV networks: ABC, CBS & NBC and big\r\n                      publishers like Hearst and Time) to lower rates across the board to win the business. While a strong portfolio dominated the\r\n                      early efforts by these Media Agencies, they also built strong attribution practices to determine the effectiveness of the ads\r\n                      placed across the landscape.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      The next medium for advertising was the personal computer in the late 1970\u2019s and ultimately the Internet in the mid 1990\u2019s. The\r\n                      ubiquity of the Internet revolutionized the ways people consume content and purchase goods on a massive scale. The opportunities\r\n                      for advertising were virtually unlimited, and the advertisers and media agencies would have to begin to adapt to this\r\n                      revolutionary, fast-growing technology.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Smaller agencies focused on the new Internet technology began popping up with the aim of bridging the gap between web publishers\r\n                      and advertisers. These digital media agencies became indispensible in assisting advertisers in reaching this new flourishing new\r\n                      online audience. Advertisers began spending money on digital channels as can be seen in the chart below. By the year 2000 the\r\n                      online industry reached $2 billion in overall media spend. Noting the chart to side overall spend will reach nearly $100 Billion\r\n                      by 2019.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      These digital agencies focused their attention on the different formats available for advertising on the Internet. Google first\r\n                      home launched in 1996, see image side. Today they are the dominate force in Search Engine Marketing. Google allows advertisers\r\n                      to customize text ads, which would serve against individual Internet searches. Email marketing, the next incarnation of direct\r\n                      mail or catalog marketing, would target individual\u2019s email addresses with offers catered to subscriber lists. Finally, the\r\n                      development of the banner advertisement and visual billboards online became known as \u2018display advertising.\u2019\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      The first banner advertisement, or \u2018display ad\u2019 appeared on hotwired.com, the Internet publication of Wired Magazine in 1994.\r\n                      The ad below facilitated by Modem Media was sold to AT&T.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      With the expansion of the World Wide Web a new market emerged. Websites, much like newspapers in the early advertising of\r\n                      advertising, began to focus on the number of people who would be exposed to the ad. With billions of web pages visited every\r\n                      day, the potential audience is huge, allowing advertisers to reach larger audiences than ever before.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Along with unprecedented reach, display ads allow advertisers the unique ability to measure and target their audiences. Cookies\r\n                      allow a technology provider to stamp a user\u2019s browser with an ID number. In this way a consumer can be tracked around the\r\n                      Internet, much in the same way that animals can be stamped and traced. Internet technology allows direct 1:1 insight into the\r\n                      effectiveness of an advertising campaign. This is revolutionary compared to television, print, and outdoor, which must be\r\n                      determined using in-store sales to measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      With the addition of cookies the concept of \u201ctarget advertising\u201d became a reality. Quickly it became possible to serve ads on\r\n                      specific websites or subsets of a specific publisher. Using cookies, companies began providing profiles of how users browsed the\r\n                      web independent of the specific website in which the ad would appear. These capabilities, which are still evolving, provide much\r\n                      more control for both advertisers and publishers in how ads are placed compared to all other forms of traditional advertising.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      With the clear advantages of display advertising, two types of organizations emerged as suppliers of display inventory:\r\n                      publishers and networks. Major publishers focused on the same sales strategies as they had through other channels such as a\r\n                      magazine. They placed ads on the top or the side of the webpage. Publishers would approach agencies to discuss specific sections\r\n                      (news, finance, sports, entertainment, etc.), the amount of visitation and the demographic breakout of the audiences who\r\n                      regularly view these pages as defined by third party audience verification tools. These publishers would offer this space on a\r\n                      CPM (cost per mille, Latin meaning thousand) and compared the price per ad exposure or impression to the other channels, like\r\n                      the circulation statistics use for pricing a magazine ad.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Ad networks were born in the late 1990\u2019s, first as firms whom would represent publishers and act as middlemen selling their\r\n                      inventory to agencies. One of the earliest networks was TeknoSurf founded in 1998 that went on to become Advertising.com who was\r\n                      eventually swallowed by AOL.Usually these were smaller publishers who were unable to fund their own sales teams. Boutique\r\n                      magazines, inspired bloggers, small newspapers, public record aggregators, and others would begin driving traffic to their\r\n                      websites. Networks specialized in \u2018traffic monetization\u2019, handling the operations behind selling and managing the banner\r\n                      inventory that would show on the website.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Ad network came to define any organization that would amass a group of publishers and present their inventory in bulk to buyers.\r\n                      They could establish the same metrics as the larger publishers and sell this inventory on a CPM basis. Because their clients\r\n                      were usually publishers focused on producing content and not monetization, the Networks could sell the inventory at a low CPM\r\n                      while providing the publishers with a new, and at times substantial, revenue stream.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      To entice advertisers, these ad networks began building in house ad delivery technology or ad servers. This became an arms race,\r\n                      where the networks could customize the technology to offer new products. Founded in 1996, Double Click was one of the first\r\n                      third party adsevers and today is the largest and I sowned by Google. They used this technology to allow advertisers to measure\r\n                      clicks and \u2018conversions.\u2019 Conversions are actions taken by a user who is exposed to an ad for Nike then later buys the sneakers\r\n                      from Nike.com. They created frequency capping, meaning a user would only see the same ad a certain number of times per day (or\r\n                      per hour, month, etc.). They would sequence ads, meaning advertisers could create stories played out over several pages. These\r\n                      advancements in technology continued to improve drastically as computer space (servers) became cheaper and cheaper.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Along with the explosion of search advertising, display advertising grew year over year from 2002 \u2013 2008. This constant growth\r\n                      benefited both the major publishers and the networks. According to www.adnetworkdirectory.com there are currently 449 Networks \u2013\r\n                      most of which began during the upward swing online advertising.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      The network model continues to grow today. Ad networks now come in many different forms and vary from organizations that\r\n                      represent very prestigious publishers on a transparent and fair basis to technology experts who use jargon to win agency\r\n                      budgets.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      With so many different types of content providers and middle men, the world of display advertising remains very difficult to\r\n                      navigate. There are thousands of ad tech companies approaching agencies. Ultimately, ad serving has become a centerpiece for the\r\n                      entire display ecosystem and computers became extremely cheap and extremely fast at the end of the 00s, paving the way for new\r\n                      developments in the Ad Tech world. In January 2007, the patent was filed for the Online Ad Exchange, which marks the official\r\n                      introduction of Real-Time Bidding (RTB), the next technological step in the evolution of advertising.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <br/>\r\n\r\n                  <p >\r\n                    <h3 id=\u201cfourproblemsofrtb\u201d><strong>The Four Problems Solved by RTB</strong></h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Real-time bidding (RTB) or what has become know as \u201cProgrammatic\u201d technology allows instantaneous decision making with regard to\r\n                      which ad will show on a [website. Instead of deciding in advance which assets the ad server will display, now the decision could\r\n                      be made as the user loads the website page. The ad server runs an auction to sell the ad space in real time, forming an online\r\n                      ad exchange driven by a Sell Side Platform. Not surprisingly, this technology has seen strong adoption and continues to thrive\r\n                      today.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      While the technology was developed in early 2007 it wasn\u2019t until later that the market began adopting at scale. The technology\r\n                      is now used by much of the market and the amount of money spent through RTB continues to increase each year. 1\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      RTB technology provides solutions to numerous problems that plague publishers and advertisers trying to buy and sell digital ad\r\n                      space. On the publisher\u2019s side, RTB technology solves issues of forecasting and unsold inventory. On the advertiser\u2019s side, RTB\r\n                      manages issues of distrust and control.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Forecasting Issues\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      As display advertising became a \u2018must buy\u2019 for digital agencies, all major advertisers began purchasing inventory. The most\r\n                      prestigious brands started cutting up-front deals with their favorite publishers. All of the leading online publishers\r\n                      established \u2018yield management\u2019 teams who were tasked with ensuring the rates created enough demand to fill the supply. These\r\n                      teams would use data from the ad server, as well as other third party applications, to determine how many impressions were\r\n                      available in each section. They would then price out the inventory (available impressions) in the interest of maximizing\r\n                      revenue. Some publishers pulled talent from the airline industry, as they were the most advanced in supply/demand analysis and\r\n                      inventory management.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      The yield management team would use historical data to determine how many visitors on each page. Using spreadsheets, advanced\r\n                      database techniques, or third party software, these teams would estimate how many ad impressions would be available for sale in\r\n                      the future. Sales teams would, in turn, approach the market and sell the inventory, in pieces, to any advertiser willing to pay\r\n                      the premium prices. To avoid constantly providing \u2018make-goods\u2019, or future inventory due to under delivery, the yield management\r\n                      team would forecast 5%-10% less than the exact amount they anticipated. The inventory would vary by day and the forecasted\r\n                      inventory vs. sold inventory would look like this chart:\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      All area in between actual delivery and the forecast are areas of lost revenue where \u2018house ads\u2019 or self-promoting ads served\r\n                      instead of a paying advertiserUnpredictability, an inherent characteristic of the Internet, creates a far larger loss of revenue\r\n                      than shown above. The Internet provides the most up to the minute information possible, and when major events happen websites\r\n                      can see 10x the traffic they had forecasted. The supply spike can occur on a weather website as a northeaster approaches, a news\r\n                      website during a natural disaster, a gossip website after the sudden death of a major celebrity. The advertisers do not want\r\n                      \u2018uneven delivery\u2019, meaning the publisher cannot deliver all of the impressions for a 12-week campaign in one single day. This\r\n                      means that when a spike of 10x occurs, even if the yield team anticipates this based on the morning numbers, they cannot deliver\r\n                      more than 2x or 3x the amount they predicted. The monetization of that day would look like this:\r\n\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Depending on circumstance, this could equate to lost revenues anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to several million, all\r\n                      due to the inability to monetize inventory in one single day.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Unsold Forcasted Inventory\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Premium publishers who can sell the ability to reach a specific niche audiences are often able to set their prices correctly as\r\n                      to sell through 100% of their inventory. Other publishers have the opposite problem. The largest internet publishers, or portals\r\n                      to the internet, amassed such enormous traffic they can not sell all of their ad space at effective rates. The largest portals\r\n                      saw three billion visits a day at times. Three ads on a page per day equates to 9,000,000,000 available each day. If\r\n                      organizations with too much inventory could determine a method to sell the long-tail or \u2018remnant\u2019 inventory at even a $0.01 CPM\r\n                      they would make millions of dollars a month in extra revenue. While remnant solutions were available, they still could not\r\n                      handle the majority of this unsold inventory.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Distrust\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      When Ad Networks started gaining popularity in around circa 2000 they all represented unique publishers and could show\r\n                      differentiation with their \u2018site lists\u2019 or domains in which ads would serve. The biggest publishers began running their ads\r\n                      across several different networks. This style of yield management would become the core of the Internet publishing business. By\r\n                      rotating the ads, the networks began having an issue of differentiation, as the same site would be available across a variety of\r\n                      networks. Additonally, many of these adnets were restricted to selling blindly or undisclosed inorder not to undermine the\r\n                      publishers relatinships with marketers.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      To achieve the scale necessary they began to avoid disclosing to buyers the delivery reports by domain. They would insist they\r\n                      could not share how the delivery varied across the websites on the \u2018site list\u2019. This would allow them to \u2018dump\u2019 a lot of\r\n                      inventory on a low quality website. Facebook apps such as Farmville, websites such as myclassmates.com and dictionary.com are\r\n                      classic locations where you will see network ads in volumes, which are not conveyed to the agency or more importantly the\r\n                      advertiser. These networks could also adjust their margin methodology and charge advertisers margins as high as 70%-80%.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Some networks began using other forms of technology to show differentiation. Networks claimed uniqueness by \u201cfocusing on a\r\n                      special audience\u201d or \u201cproviding scale\u201d or \u201cusing contextual search technology,\u201d but until the advancement of the programmatic\r\n                      RTB exchange there was basically no difference between these organizations as they all worked with the same publishers.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      As these problems leaked out of the back rooms of these networks and into the ears of media buyers, there was a clear need for\r\n                      greater transparency. By handling the auction for the advertising space on an impression-by-impression basis, the RTB exchange\r\n                      offered a technological solution.\r\n                      <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                      <p>\r\n                        Control\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        The networks were the first to implement and develop ad serving technology and continued to develop in the interest of their\r\n                        own bottom lines. The best advances in targeting were made available to the publishers. Publishers could use the up to date ad\r\n                        servers to control what type of ads would show on a certain section of a website, in a specific geographical location, or at a\r\n                        particular time. While advertisers could request these targeting parameters, there was no control on their side of how the ads\r\n                        were served. Someone on the publisher or network side needed to handle the trafficking.\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        As the lack of control became a growing issue on the advertiser side, the RTB technology became available. Programmatic pushed\r\n                        the \u2018control\u2019 into the hands of the \u201cbuy-side\u201d or what is often refered to Demand-side. This allowed allowed the advertiser to\r\n                        manage how they want to target their ads across publishers (in bulk, becoming \u2018exchanges\u2019). This was a clear benefit for all\r\n                        involved, as the newfound confidence led to larger budgets.\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        The RTB exchange provided solutions to these four issues, but the agencies we\u2019re set in their ways and comfortable with the\r\n                        accustomed methods. Changing the way an entire industry behaves takes time and takes \u2018buy-in\u2019 from big players early. How\r\n                        could the networks and publishers ensure the advertisers would test this technology that offered \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018transparency\u2019\r\n                        into pricing and targeting? They created an auction environment promising the buyers they would pay only a \u2018penny\u2019 more than\r\n                        the next highest bidder for each impression. This Second Price Auction method created a \u2018perfect\u2019 market allowing the next\r\n                        generation of media to emerge: Programmatic Media.\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <span style={{textDecoration: \u2018underline\u2019}}>References</span>\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                          <li>1 http://www.iab.net/about_the_iab/recent_press_releases/press_release_archive/1996_pr_archive\r\n                          </li>\r\n                          <li>2 (or nodes, or boxes, or servers - all terms which refer to a computer, usually without a monitor and in a building\r\n                            with no windows somewhere relatively unpopulated)\r\n                          </li>\r\n                          <li>3 Pemberton, Steve. http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/Talks/2011/05-07-steven-visualisation/ , CWI and W3C, Amsterdam, ?\r\n                            2011\r\n                          </li>\r\n                          <li>4 http://www.google.com/patents/US20070192356.pdf\r\n                          </li>\r\n                          <li>5 http://adage.com/article/digital/real-time-bidding-account-25-display-ad-spending-2015-emarketer/238300/\r\n                          </li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                          Bidders\r\n                          <br/>\r\n                          <br/>\r\n                          Programmatic advertising allows \u2018bidders\u2019 to bid on advertising space made available by publishers.
